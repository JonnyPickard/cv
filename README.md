After recently finishing my Biology degree I decided to pursue my passion and get into tech. I spent months learning small amounts of code and eventually decided that a bootcamp was the best way to accelerate the process. I attended Makers Academy in London where I learnt to code multiple web technologies, using best practices from the ground up. We studied full stack development covering Ruby on Rails, AngularJS and more. We also worked on a number of agile, team, test and behaviourally driven larger projects.

After MA I undertook a Swift contract to build an iOS app called [Scores on the Doors](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/food-hygiene/id378087298?mt=8). This was an incredible challenge being written in a relatively new language with no help from seniors and little to no online resources. However, I can now be proud to say that after even less than a year of coding I have managed to release a production iOS app.

Working solo on a contract for a few months only served to highlight how important working in a team is for me. I'm now looking to progress as a full stack developer into a team environment, with opportunities to contribute to larger projects, bounce ideas off my peers and receive mentoring from seniors.
